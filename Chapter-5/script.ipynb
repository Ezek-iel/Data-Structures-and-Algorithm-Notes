    "1. It should be consistent such that $f(A) => B$ and $f(A) => C$ is wrong\n",

    "1. Phone books\n",
    "2. DNS resolutions (_mapping an url to an ipaddress_)\n",

    "4. Hash tables as a cache\n",
    "\n",
    "## Collisions\n",
    "2 keys being assigned to the same position to the hash array. meaning that (__hash functions are really important__)\n",
